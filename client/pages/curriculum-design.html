            <p>
                Out on this tract with a long term vision of shaking up the dynamics of this beautiful Ball-game in India, we, here, at Golazo Sports, are committed to providing the young emerging talents with the best of platforms to DREAM BIG. Our love of football is truly at the heart of everything we do. Backed with the drive for EXCELLENCE and INTEGRITY, we believe in a 360 degree approach to football: identifying talent, investing in and developing young players and assisting them in every step of the way, to help them make the best possible decisions both on and off the pitch.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Our entire academy program is curated and implemented by our Academy Director, and Head Coach Enrico Manganaro. He's a UEFA-B Licensed coach who is here with us from Italy to revolutionise Football in Indore.
            </p>

            <h2>Skill Development</h2>

            <p>
                From warm up to cool down, our training program has been specifically devised to improve the overall play of the kid and help him upgrade his technical skills. As a young player develops, his/her technical skills will set the foundations for good development and enable him/her to experience all of the joy that football can bring.
            </p>

            <h2>On & Off Field Footballing Intelligence</h2>

            <p>
                “Football is a game you play with your brain” – Johan Cruyff. We, at Golazo, firmly believe that Footballing Intelligence is a Skill that needs proper guidance and polishing under a well thought-of programme. Our coaches expertise in positional awareness, tactical proficiency, anticipation or reading of the game, making fast and efficient decisions and recognising patterns.
            </p>

            <h2>Wu-Wei</h2>
            <p>
                As per the Chinese philosophy ‘Wu-Wei’(pronounced as “ooo-way”), is a concept of effortless or instinctive action. We aim to achieve that in football through mindful training wherein we believe that the more a kid plays, the earlier a kid plays, and the more variety of playing, the better athlete they tend to be. Football revolves around the ability to move, run, jump, dribble, kick, etc. These fundamental patterns are ingrained at young ages and nurtured throughout the developmental stages of pre-pubescence to professional levels.
            </p>

            <h2>Seminal Talent Management</h2>
            <p>
                At Golazo, our approach to Football is formative, wherein our programme is thoroughly customised owing to variegated skill and potential of an individual. We are committed to provide Indore the platform to take a step forward in its dream to pursue football as a career. Our Management Team commits to not only track the overall growth of the kid but also to make sure that his/her talent gets showcased at an appurtenant level.
