            Everyone loses games, few change them.
            Out on this tract with a long term vision of shaking up the dynamics of this beautiful Ball-game in India, we, here,
            at
            Golazo Sports, are committed to providing the young emerging talents with the best of platforms to DREAM BIG. Our
            love
            of football is truly at the heart of everything we do. Backed with the drive for EXCELLENCE and INTEGRITY, we
            believe in
            a 360 degree approach to football: identifying talent, investing in and developing young players and assisting them
            in
            every step of the way, to help them make the best possible decisions both on and off the pitch.

            Our entire academy program is curated and implemented by our Academy Director, and Head Coach Enrico Manganaro. He's
            a
            UEFA-B Licensed coach who is here with us from Italy to revolutionise Football in Indore.

            SKILL DEVELOPMENT

            From warm up to cool down, our training program has been specifically devised to improve the overall play of the kid
            and
            help him upgrade his technical skills. As a young player develops, his/her technical skills will set the foundations
            for
            good development and enable him/her to experience all of the joy that football can bring.

            ON & OFF-FIELD FOOTBALLING INTELLIGENCE

            “Football is a game you play with your brain” – Johan Cruyff. We, at Golazo, firmly believe that Footballing
            Intelligence is a Skill that needs proper guidance and polishing under a well thought-of programme. Our coaches
            expertise in positional awareness, tactical proficiency, anticipation or reading of the game, making fast and
            efficient
            decisions and recognising patterns.

            Wu-Wei

            As per the Chinese philosophy ‘Wu-Wei’(pronounced as “ooo-way”), is a concept of effortless or instinctive action.
            We
            aim to achieve that in football through mindful training wherein we believe that the more a kid plays, the earlier a
            kid
            plays, and the more variety of playing, the better athlete they tend to be. Football revolves around the ability to
            move, run, jump, dribble, kick, etc. These fundamental patterns are ingrained at young ages and nurtured throughout
            the
            developmental stages of pre-pubescence to professional levels.

            Seminal Talent Management

            At Golazo, our approach to Football is formative, wherein our programme is thoroughly customised owing to variegated
            skill and potential of an individual. We are committed to provide Indore the platform to take a step forward in its
            dream to pursue football as a career. Our Management Team commits to not only track the overall growth of the kid
            but
            also to make sure that his/her talent gets showcased at an appurtenant level.
